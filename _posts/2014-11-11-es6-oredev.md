While attending the developer conference [Øredev](http://oredev.org) last week, I had the pleasure of giving a talk on [es6](http://vimeo.com/111289052). Many of the new features I covered touch on challenges we've faced building the [Azure Portal](/2014/09/20/how-the-azure-portal-works/). Instead of covering each new feature one by one ([Luke Hoban already does a nice job of that](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features)) I decided to cover a few high level features that fundamentally affect the way teams build large scale JavaScript applications.
