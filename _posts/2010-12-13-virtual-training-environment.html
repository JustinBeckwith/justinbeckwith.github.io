excerpt: The Virtual Training Environment (VTE) is a Learning Management System designed at the Software Engineering Institute of Carnegie Mellon University.  This system is designed to provide students and instructors with a self managed ecosystem, including user generated content and aspects of social networking.  It may be used for independent learners, synchronous instruction, or semi-synchronous instruction.  Courses may be built using SCORM content, RECast presentations, podcasts, demos, quizzes, surveys, assignments, or virtual labs.
