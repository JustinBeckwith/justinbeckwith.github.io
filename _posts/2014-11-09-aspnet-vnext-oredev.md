    Last week I had the amazing opportunity to give a talk on <a href="http://asp.net/vNext" target="_blank">ASP.NET vNext</a> at the <a href="http://oredev.org" target="_blank">Øredev</a> developer conference.  I had a blast - especially the part where I got to show off the new bits to a few hundred people on the big stage.  It's especially fun showing off the new features that open up ASP.NET development with Mono on OSX.  There's a lot of great stuff in this release - the new request pipeline, bin deployable CLR, command line tools, configuration APIs, SublimeText support, fewer dependencies on Visual Studio - and lots of open source.
