# About

![Picture of Justin Beckwith at Node Summit](/img/jbatns.jpg)

Greetings folks! I'm Justin. With over 25 years of experience in the tech industry, I like to hang my hat on empathetic leadership and a deep love for the web. I've worked at places like Discord, Google, Microsoft, and others trying to make the web just a little bit better. Outside of tech I'm a husband, father of 3 awesome kids, and a dog enjoyer.  I spend my free time picking up heavy rocks and putting them back down.  I think we can all be just a little bit nicer.  I'd love to hear from you!
