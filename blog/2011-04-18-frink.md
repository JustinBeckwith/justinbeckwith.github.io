Frink! is a mobile client for the web site [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com). It is designed specifically to be used with tablets, taking advantage of gestures in a unique user interface. Right now the app is available in the BlackBerry App World:

After the code has a little time to settle, I plan on releasing the app to the Android Market as well. The entire project is open source, and available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/JustinBeckwith/frink).
