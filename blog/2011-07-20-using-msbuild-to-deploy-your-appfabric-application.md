description: 'As the hosting of applications moves from our local staging environments to the cloud, one of the areas that needs to improve is the ability to include deployment in our automated build processes. Using the June CTP AppFabric bits, Visual Studio does an excellent job of enabling developers to design, build, and deploy AppFabric applications. However, the current tools do not provide a way to integrate these tools into a standard, repeatable build process. The goal of this post is to outline the steps necessary to integrate automated AppFabric deployment into your build process, and show off some of the REST API features weâ€™ve built into the Application Manager.'
