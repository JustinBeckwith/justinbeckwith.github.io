The Virtual Training Environment (VTE) is a Learning Management System designed at the Software Engineering Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. This system is designed to provide students and instructors with a self managed ecosystem, including user generated content and aspects of social networking. It may be used for independent learners, synchronous instruction, or semi-synchronous instruction. Courses may be built using SCORM content, RECast presentations, podcasts, demos, quizzes, surveys, assignments, or virtual labs.
